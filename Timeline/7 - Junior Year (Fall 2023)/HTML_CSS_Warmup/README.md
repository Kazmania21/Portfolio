# HTML/CSS Project
>A standard calculator that lets you perform math problems easier.

## How to Install
Click [here](https://github.com/Kazmania21/Portfolio/raw/master/Timeline/7%20-%20Junior%20Year%20(Fall%202023)/HTML_CSS_Warmup.zip) to start the installation.

### Optional
You can extract the application folder out of the installed zip file. This is not required but it can make the application easier to get to.

## How to Run
Double click the "index.html" file within the downloaded folder to start the application. 
If the application folder has not been extracted outside of the zip folder as described in the optional step above, you will need to go to the HTML_CSS_Warmup folder inside of the zip file before you see the "index.html" file.

## Features
1. An web page explaining HTML.
2. An web page explaining CSS.
3. Styling to customize the look of both pages.

## Disclaimer
This was a team project between me and one other person (Asa Foulke). We each worked on one page. "Index.html" was Asa's work. Mine was "Page2.html". We both worked on the styling.
