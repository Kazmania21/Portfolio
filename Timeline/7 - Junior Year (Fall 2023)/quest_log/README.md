# Quest Log
>A todo list that allows you to take individual tasks and divide them into steps.

## How to Install
Click [here](https://github.com/Kazmania21/Portfolio/raw/master/Timeline/7%20-%20Junior%20Year%20(Fall%202023)/quest_log.zip) to start the installation.

### Optional
You can extract the application folder out of the installed zip file. This is not required but it can make the application easier to get to.

## How to Run
Open the "dist" folder double click the "quest_log.exe" file within the downloaded folder to start the application. 
If the application folder has not been extracted outside of the zip folder as described in the optional step above, you will need to go to the quest_log folder inside of the zip file before you see the shortcut.

## Features
1. Breaks tasks (quest lines) down into individual steps (quests).
2. Displays one or more quests for each quest line at a time.
3. Displays the next quest in that quest line once the previous quest is marked as complete.
4. Allows the user to add, edit, and delete quests and quest lines.
